## Project Essentials Cooldown: cooldown module for Project Essentials.

<img src="./assets/cooldown_social_logo.jpg">

### What is it

This module is responsible for cooldown Minecraft commands. The mod adds a delay for the use of commands, prevents command-spamming and limits the number of uses for a certain time. A mod can also create cooldown for command aliases. The delay and other settings are controlled by the configuration of the mod. Useful information and documentation are [here](https://mairwunnx.gitbook.io/project-essentials/project-essentials-cooldown#applying-aliases).

You can also use the API, for example, as a delay in the use of an item or the like, but instead of commands, you can use identifiers. (This is one of the ideas for use by third-party developers).
