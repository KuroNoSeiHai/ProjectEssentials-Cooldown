## Project Essentials Cooldown: cooldown module for Project Essentials.

<img src="./assets/cooldown_social_logo.jpg">

### What is it

This module is responsible for cooldown Minecraft teams. The mod adds a delay for the use of commands, prevents command-spamming and limits the number of uses for a certain time. A mod can also create cooldown for command aliases. The delay and other settings are controlled by the configuration of the mod. Useful information and documentation are [here](documentation/for-developers.md).

You can also use the API, for example, as a delay in the use of an item or the like, but instead of commands, you can use identifiers. (This is one of the ideas for use by third-party developers).

### After you got the dependencies and the library itself:

# [getting started with read the documentation](./documentation/in-using.md)

### **Note:** this library is written in kotlin, but in java you can work with this API too, but there may be some not beautiful moments. One of these points is that you will see all the properties and fields with internal modifiers (in my library).
